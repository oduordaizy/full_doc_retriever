The study  showed  \\nmodels  have  accurately  predicted  the compressive  strength  of laboratory -manufacture d concrete  \\nthan to industry  based -concrete  mixtures . Apart  from  compressive  strength,  studies  on the \\npredictions  of shear  strength  of beams  and bar length  have  also been  carried  out to assist /prior  to \\nconstruction  activities  [43,44 ]. Besides  these  models , a few studies  have  also used RF [16], \\nHydrostatic -Seasonal -Time  (HST ) model  [45], Multilayer  Perceptron  (MLP ) [46], Convolutional  \\nneural  networks  (CNN ) model  [47,48 ], Gaussian  Processes  (GP)  [49], M5P [50], long short -term \\nmemory  networks  (LSTM ) model  [51], multiple  linear  regression  (MLR)  [52], gene expression  \\nprogramming  (GEP)  [53] and linear  regression  [54] to predict  compressive  strength  and other  \\nparameters  of waste -based  concrete  along with different  input  parameters  and obtained  the \\nadequate  output s [55–57]. \\n1.1. Research  significance  \\nBesides  the employment  of ML models,  numerous  experimental  studies  have  been  conducted  by \\nseveral  researchers  on the effect  of the addition  of fly ash on the compressive  strength  of \\nconcrete  [58–61]. Only a chunk  of studies  has been  carried  out on the prediction  of compressive  \\nstrength  of fly-ash-based  concrete  using  the ML model s. Researchers  have  adopted  gene  \\nexpression  programming  GEP , SVM,  ANN,  MLR  and some  other  models  to forecast  the \\ncompressive  strength  of fly-ash concrete  and obtained  good  accuracy  with low errors  [16,39,62 ]. \\nHowever,  most  of the studies  have  used very few models  using  a smaller  number  of input  \\nparameters.  Also,  the performance  of the models  had not been checked  adequately  as the \\nexecution  of a few assessments  had been  reported  on the prediction  of strength  parameter s for \\nfly-ash-based  concrete.  In addition,  the use of silica  content,  lime content,  iron oxide  content  and \\naluminum  oxide  as input  paramet ers hasn’t  been  reported  for predicting  the strength  of concrete.  \\nConsidering  these  shortcomings , the current  study  aims  to predict  the compressive  strength  of fly \\nash-based  concrete  through  nine different  ML models  such as Linear  Regression  (LR),  Gradient  \\nBoost  (XGboost  or GB),  Random  Forest  (RF),  Decision  Tree (DT),  Support  Vector  Machines  \\n(SVM)  regression,  M5P, Gaussian  Processes  (GP),  Multilayer  Perceptron  (MLP) and Artificial  \\nNeural  Network  (ANN).

We are planning to develop an automatic ﬁnancial complaint\\nclassiﬁcation system that automatically deals with the customer complaints by\\nsegregating the data & routing it to the right department. We are planning\\nto develop the system by using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artiﬁcial\\nIntelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) & Deep Learning (DL) concepts and\\nimplement using Python, Jupyter Notebook,.etc. The end product will be a web-\\nbased application system where customer can register their complaints with-\\nout having to worry about sending it to right department. (Bejarano) Devel-\\noped system will automatically segregate the complaints & route it to the right\\ndepartment. Through this project we are trying to attain best results for our\\ncomplaint classiﬁcation task by comparing various Machine Learning (ML)\\nmodels, Deep Learning (DL) models and Ensemble methods on basis of accu-\\nracy and time and applying the one which best suits the requirement. (Zhang,\\nZhao, and Lecun) We are using data pre-processing methods like data augmen-\\ntation, lemmatization etc and on top of that TF-IDF and Word2Vec methods for\\nML and DL models respectively.\\n1. Introduction\\nFinancial Companies get many complaints regard-\\ning their service and they have to handle those com-\\nplaints quickly and effectively so that the customers\\nwho are already angry don’t get unhappy and con-\\ntinue to trust the company. The complaints these\\ndays are handled by customer support people who\\ncan be contacted through mail or through the com-\\npany’s website.\\nReading many complaints for the customer sup-\\nport people and tagging them to route to theirrespective departments becomes hectic and also\\ntakes time to handle the complaints. Also, now big\\nﬁnancial companies have made their complaint han-\\ndling system online but require the customers them-\\nselves to tag the department to which the complain\\nshould be routed.\\nThere are high chances of customers choosing the\\nwrong department while tugging themselves due to\\nlack of knowledge about the department in ﬁnancial\\ncompanies and there are also chances of them choos-\\ning a random department since they are only inter-\\nOPEN ACCESS\\n 116', metadata={'source': 'documents/Consumer%20Complaints%20Classification%20Using%20Machine%20Learning%20%26%20Deep.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='Consumer Complaints Classiﬁcation Using Machine Learning & Deep Learning 2023, Vol. 05, Issue 05S\\n5. Results and Discussion\\nThis graph & table says about the percentages of\\nall machine learning models used and also gives the\\nuser the best algorithm to implement. Firstly for ML\\nmodels, we came to know that bi-grams performed\\nbetter than uni-gram but increased model complex-\\nity. Decision trees gave the least accuracy (71%\\nfor Unigrams & 65% for Bigrams) among all mod-\\nels similar to K-Nearest Neighbours (74% for Uni-\\ngrams & 69% for Bigrams); in contrast to Multino-\\nmial Naive Bayes (80% for Unigrams & 83% for\\nBigrams), Linear SVM (84% for Unigrams & 85%\\nfor Bigrams) and Logistic Regression (83% for Uni-\\ngrams & 82% for Bigrams) which gave more accu-\\nracy in less time. SVM is more practical as it gave\\naccuracy around 84% and took less time compare to\\nvoting method. Now, coming to DL algorithms, we\\ninferred that Word Level CNN has more Test Accu-\\nracy (82%) & less Test Loss (71%) as opposite to\\nUnidirectional LSTM with Test Accuracy & Loss\\nclocking at 78%. The choice of the model is based\\non user need based on speed and accuracy.\\nFIGURE 5. ML Models & their accuracy rates\\n6. Conclusion\\nWe eventually came to know that bi-grams per-\\nformed better than uni-gram but increased model\\ncomplexity. Decision trees gave the least accuracy\\namong all models in contrast to Linear SVM &\\nLogistic Regression which gave more accuracy in\\nless time.\\nIt’s clear that sentiment analysis and topic clas-\\nsiﬁcation can be extremely helpful to automati-\\ncally classify customer complaints, so that you canrespond quickly and efﬁciently to your customers\\nwhen they (and your company) need it the most.\\nPutting machine learning and deep learning into\\npractice can help you maintain and monitor your\\ncustomer base, 24/7, and in real time, ﬁnding cus-\\ntomer complaints from all over the web and auto-\\nmatically route them to the proper employee.\\nAuthors’ Note\\nThe authors declare that there is no conﬂict of\\ninterest regarding the publication of this article.\\nAuthors conﬁrmed that the paper was free of pla-\\ngiarism.\\nReferences\\nAriﬁanto, Anditya, et al. “Developing an LSTM-\\nbased Classiﬁcation Model of IndiHome Cus-\\ntomer Feedbacks”. 2020 International Confer-\\nence on Data Science and Its Applications\\n(ICoDSA) (2020). 10 . 1109 / icodsa50139 . 2020 .\\n9212863.\\nBejarano, Gissella. “PhD Forum: Deep Learning\\nand Probabilistic Models Applied to Sequential\\nData”. 2018 IEEE International Conference on\\nSmart Computing (SMARTCOMP) (2018).\\nChandana, C, et al. “Bank Customer Complaints\\nAnalysis Using Natural Language Processing and\\nData Mining”.
